# imgProcProj
The goal of this project is to do some very simple image processing tasks, utilizing numpy to hold the image data, and to allow us to easily modify the image data. I utilize matplotlib and numpy.

Part 1: Returns a new pattern that contains only the red, green or blue channel of the image based on 0 = red, 1 = green, 2 = blue.

Part 2: Returns permutated image based on perm given. perm is a list of 0,1,2 in some order, which specifies how to permute the color channels.

Part 3: Returns a decrypted image by XOR'ing each red, green, and blue row of the image with the key.
